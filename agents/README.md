# Step Agents
Each step has its own `AGENT.md` under `agents/STEP_xx_name/`.
The root `AGENT.md` points to the current step file via `CURRENT TASK`.

Minimal sections per step file:
- TITLE
- GOAL
- DELIVERABLES
- FILES TO CREATE OR MODIFY
- TEST PLAN (LOCAL)
- CI GATES
- GIT AND PR PLAN
- DONE CRITERIA
- CHANGELOG (append at end when done)
